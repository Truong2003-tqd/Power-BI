# What Does This Repo Have?

This repo provides you with videos, reading materials and work samples to follow. The provided materials were prepared as modules, requiring you to complete one-by-one to progress in a specific skill.

## 🔨 Excel Learning Materials

**Recommendations:** Both modules' courses instruct you how to build dashboard in Excel. However, I can focus on the usages of Excel functions and Power Pivot in these parts instead of focusing on building a dashboard. Aftering taking these courses, you can jump straight to build a dashboard in Power BI with provided instructions.

**Notes:** The materials are recommended for those who completely new to Excel. If you are experienced, you can take this as a chance to revise your understandings and move faster in those courses.
